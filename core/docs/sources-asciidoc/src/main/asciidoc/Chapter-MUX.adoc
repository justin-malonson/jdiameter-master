= Multiplexer (MUX)

The Multiplexer (MUX) is designed as a stack wrapper.
It serves two purposes:

Expose Stack::
  It exposes the stack and allows it to be shared between multiple listeners.
  The stack follows the life cycle of the MUX.
  It is created and destroyed with MUX.

Expose Management Operations::
  Exposes the management operations for  clients, one of them being the &MANAGEMENT.PLATFORM; Console.
  For specific information please refer to the {this-platform}  Diameter Management Console User Guide.
