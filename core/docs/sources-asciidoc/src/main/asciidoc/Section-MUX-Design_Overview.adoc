= Diameter Multiplexer (MUX) Design

MUX is a simple service provided on behalf of the Stack.
Entities interested in receiving messages for certain diameter applications register in MUX.
Upon registration, the entity passes a set of application IDs.
Based on the message content and registered listeners, MUX either drops the message or passes it to the proper listener.
MUX checks application IDs present in the message to match the target listener.
