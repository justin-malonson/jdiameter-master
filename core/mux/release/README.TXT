 Mobicents Diameter : Mux
==========================
              v@MUX_VERSION@

 Welcome to the Mobicents Diameter Mux v@MUX_VERSION@ release!

--------------
 Introduction
--------------

 This is the Multiplexer release of Mobicents Diameter solution.

 This multiplexer (Mux) is intended to provide aplications with ease of development, and in the future to work as a
 wrapper to the stack in order to abstract the stack being used.

 At the moment, it enables the application to register itself on the Mux for the desired Diameter Application and
 receive and send messages for that same application. With the multiplexer you can use the same Diameter implementation
 in Mobicents JAIN SLEE or Mobicents SIP Servlets.

 It also provides a Diameter dictionary which application can lookup at in order to correctly create their Diameter
 Messages and AVPs.
