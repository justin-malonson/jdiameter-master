 * As for 3GPP TS 29.172 v13.0.0, the Provide Subscriber Location operation is used by a GMLC to request the location of a
 * target UE from the MME or SGSN at any time, as part of EPC-MT-LR (Evolved Packet Core Mobile Terminated Location Request) or
 * PS-MT-LR (Packet Switched Mobile Terminated Location Request) positioning procedures. The response contains a location
 * estimate of the target UE and other additional information. This operation is also used by a GMLC to request the location of
 * the target UE from the SGSN at any time, as part of deferred MT-LR procedure. The response contains the acknowledgment of the
 * receipt of the request and other additional information.
 *
 * The Provide-Location-Request (PLR) command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to 8388620 and the "R" bit set in the
 * Command Flags field, is sent by the GMLC in order to request subscriber location to the MME or SGSN (Provide Subscriber
 * Location operation request)
