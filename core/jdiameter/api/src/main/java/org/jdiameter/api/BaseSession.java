/**
 * The session delivery objects are responsible for delivering all incoming Message to a specific session.
 * It determines the Diameter Session object that the message belongs to by querying the message's session id AVP.
 * The delivery object searches the local session database for a matching session. If no matching session is found,
 * the delivery object will lookup a matching session factory object that has an application id matching the
 * application id of the message. If there is a registered session factory, then the delivery object will ask the
 * factory to create a new session and delivery the message to the newly created session. If non of these lookup's
 * are successful, the session delivery object will silently discard the message.
 * Wrapper interface allows adapt message to any driver vendor specific interface
 * Serializable interface allows use this class in SLEE Event objects
